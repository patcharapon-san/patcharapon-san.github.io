## üöÄ What I Love About Development

### Problem Solving
There's nothing quite like the satisfaction of breaking down a complex business challenge into elegant technical components and watching them come together as a working solution. I'm a big fan of puzzle games, and coding gives me that same thrill of finding the perfect piece that makes everything click into place.

### Technology Innovation
Learning new things keeps me feeling fresh and energized. I'm particularly excited about:
- **Serverless architectures** and their potential to scale efficiently
